# Hermes---AI
I'm currently developing Hermes AI, a modular deep learning framework for post-disaster flood, damage, and debris segmentation â€” leveraging datasets like FloodNet, RescueNet, and SpaceNet-8.  My focus is on blending satellite imagery, drone footage, and multi-head segmentation models to support FEMA critical infrastructure recovery operations.
